								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="https://github.com/christopherlewis95?" target="_blank" class="image"><img src="images/ChrisHeadShot.png" alt="" /></a>

							<p> I graduated from UNR in May 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering. I am a young software developer 
								seeking opportunity to learn and thrive in the professional workplace.
							I worked on various projects throughout my past 5 years and have 
							had experience in following languages: C, C++, C#, GLSL, Java, Javascript, and HTML.
							 My strongest languages are C# and C++ but I am perfectly capable of learning
							 what is needed to get the job done without the work being sloppy. 
							 
							 <br> <br>
							I enjoy doing things like hiking, gaming, and playing board games with family and friends.
							 Although I love graphics, my interest is truely in development and being able to see
							  what I have done and see it be used in the world. I love development and problem solving, 
							  its what I consider to be the most beneficial about me.

								<h3>Project Descriptions<br> <br></h3>
								<p>For the past 5 years I have developed many projects, all of which feature something that I never tried before.
										I can make applications that range from games to one that you use in the workplace.
									   Below are projects that I have done and a brief description.</p>

											<h4>VR-Physics</h4>
											<p><br>
												VR-Physics is a virtual reality physics game that was inspired by previous work brought on by 
												<a href="https://scholarworks.unr.edu//handle/11714/2239" target="_blank"> <b>Benjamin Brown's Thesis. </b></a> 
												This took some elements taken from his thesis and allowed for an educational game that was fun and engaging for the user.

										<div class="inner">
											<h4>VR-Physics Website</h4>
											<p><br>
												This is a website that showcases VR-Physics for any visitor interested in the product. 
												This website was built by myself and uses some functionality provided by HTML5UP. <br> <br>

												Visit the website by following this link 
												here -> <a href="https://vr-physics.github.io/" target="_blank"> <b>Proceed to VR-Physics!</b></a>

											<a href="https://www.cse.unr.edu/~christopherlewis/UnityGames/WebAngryBirdsReplica/" target="_blank" class="image"><img src="images/angrybirds.png" alt="" /></a>
										<div class="inner">
											<h4>Angry Birds Replica</h4>
											<p><br>
												This is a game that had a soul purpose of being able to manipulate and use a library (in this case a physics library)
												and use it to my advantage. This included gravity, physics hit detections, and using background information to 
												determine when certain events happen.

											<a href="https://www.cse.unr.edu/~christopherlewis/UnityGames/BATTLEBOXES/" target="_blank" class="image"><img src="images/battleboxes.png" alt="" /></a>
										<div class="inner">
											<h4>Battleboxes - Enhanced Deluxe Edition</h4>
											<p><br>
												This is a game that allows two players to competitively play against eachother in a contained environment. 
												I built this game to be able to run two separate instances simultaneously and have no input delays.
											</p>

											<a  class="image"><img src="images/mariopinball.png" alt="" /></a>
										<div class="inner">
											<h4>Mario Pinball (All Art Owned By Nintendo)</h4>
											<p><br>
												This is a graphics project in which I was included in a team that had various aspects like: lighting, physics, and it is a playable game.
												Parts of this project were challenging. One of these parts was the <a href="http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/" target="_blank"> <b>Bullet Physics Library</b></a>. 
												This was challenging because I had to understand code that I did not read and it was horribly documented. 
												This is important in software engineering because you need to know how to read and understand other's code.

											<a href="https://www.cse.unr.edu/~christopherlewis/UnityGames/Team5-VoidRealmWeb/" target="_blank" class="image"><img src="images/voidrealm.png" alt="" /></a>
										<div class="inner">
											<h4>Void Realm</h4>
											<p><br>
												Void Realm is a game that features mechanics inspired from multiple games. This is a game that uses the Unity 2017 Engine and 
												features a top-down perspective. For those who dont know Unity, this engine is not really great for top down 2D games. 
												This project is an attempt at using engine for a top down game and take mechanics from Fallout and Legend of Zelda.
												These mechanics include an in-game terminal, Zelda style dungeons, and powers to use during your journey.

											<a href="https://www.cse.unr.edu/~christopherlewis/UnityGames/Team5-PuzzleGame/" target="_blank" class="image"><img src="images/shapebros.png" alt="" /></a>
										<div class="inner">
											<h4>Shape Bros</h4>
											<p><br>
												This is a project where the premise was to allow for multiple playable characters. 
												This game is inspired by games like A Way Out, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, and Thomas Was Alone. 
												The game is also meant to be an educational experience where shapes take a huge place in the puzzles.

										<div class="inner">
											<h4>My No Name Game (Mobile Only)</h4>
											<p><br>
												My No Name Game is exactly what it sounds like. A game that doesn't have a name! I used assets 
												created by myself from Battleboxes: Deluxe Enhanced Edition. This game is my first android application 
												and it worked for multiple devices like: Samsung Galexy S4/S5/S6/S7, Note 1/2 (XL included), and Nexus 5.
											</p>
										</div>
									</article>
									<article>
											<a class="image"><img src="images/perspective.png" alt="" /></a>
										<div class="inner">
											<h4>Team 7 Perspective Puzzles</h4>
											<p><br>
												This was the second virtual reality game that I was part of. 
												This game features puzzles that are purely based on perspective.
												One puzzle is where you can make yourself the size of a mouse or the size of a giant to navigate a house searching for keys.
												The next puzzle is when you use a flashlight to cast shadows that make a code.
